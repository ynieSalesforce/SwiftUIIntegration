## What is this project?
This project is a walkthrough the journey we took to go from UIKit and view models with ReactiveSwift to using Observable objects, and finally with Composable Architecture

## Get Started
To get started, first go to [Open Weather](https://home.openweathermap.org/api_keys) and generate an API key. Replace the `openWeatherAPIKey` variable in the file `WeatherServiceURL.swift` with your API Key.

Then when you build for the first time, you will have to `Trust and Enable` a few frameworks that are related to ComposableArchitecture.
